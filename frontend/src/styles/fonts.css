/*
Self-hosted fonts.

This file is intentionally safe to ship even if you haven't downloaded fonts yet.
To actually self-host Fraunces + IBM Plex Sans, run:

  ./scripts/selfhost-fonts.sh

That script will download the required `.woff2` files into `public/fonts/` and
rewrite this file with the corresponding `@font-face` rules.
